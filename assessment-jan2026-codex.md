Section 1 - Modeling a Messy Narrative
Time: 30 minutes

Scenario:
A college has a shared Equipment Room where students borrow items like cameras, tripods, laptops, and microphones.

- Students fill a form to request items.
- Some expensive items need faculty approval.
- Each student can borrow up to 2 items for up to 3 days.
- Late returns incur a fine per day.
- If an item is more than 7 days late, the student account is blocked.
- Student clubs can reserve items in advance for events.
- Staff sometimes extend due dates by email when there are no other requests.
- Items are sometimes lost and disputes happen about who had the item last.

1.1 List the key entities and roles in this system.
1.2 List the rules, constraints, and relationships you can infer.
1.3 Describe a simple step-by-step flow from request to return.
1.4 Change request: allow students to extend a loan online by 2 days if no one is waiting.
    What else would need to change or be checked because of this?

Section 2 - Understanding and Combining Information
Time: 40 minutes

Your college wants to improve the bus system. You are given the following information:

Source A - Student Survey
- 62% say buses are late
- 70% want real-time tracking
- 45% want more buses
- 30% say mornings are empty but evenings are crowded

Source B - College Admin
- Budget cannot be increased
- Only 10% of buses run full
- GPS tracking pilot was done but discontinued
- Evening demand is 4x morning demand

Source C - Bus Drivers
- Delays due to traffic
- Students take time because of ID scanning
- GPS devices did not work well
- Better route planning needed

2.1 What do all three sources agree on? What do they disagree on?
2.2 Students want more buses, but the college cannot increase the budget. How would you handle this contradiction?
2.3 Propose a balanced solution using all three sources. Include one measurable success metric.
2.4 List three pieces of additional information that would improve your recommendation.

Section 3 - Finding Patterns
Time: 20 minutes

Situation A:
College WiFi becomes slow between 2-4 PM.

Situation B:
The gym is full between 6-8 PM but empty at most other times.

Situation C:
The library printer queue becomes very long right before assignment deadlines.

3.1 What is the common idea or pattern in all three situations?
3.2 Describe the pattern in simple, general terms without mentioning WiFi, gym, or printers.
3.3 Apply the same pattern:
"In a cafeteria with 120 seats, students sometimes cannot find seats even though the average occupancy is only 40%."
Explain why this happens and suggest one solution.

Section 4 - Figuring Out Why Something Is Wrong
Time: 25 minutes

You built a simple timer app. When you set it for 10 minutes, sometimes it rings at 11 minutes, and sometimes at 9 minutes.

4.1 Write at least four possible reasons why this might be happening.
4.2 For each reason, write a simple test to confirm it. Each test should check only one thing.
4.3 If more than one reason seems possible, explain how you would find the actual root cause.

Section 5 - Working with Limits and Choosing What Matters
Time: 30 minutes

You and three friends want to build a simple FAQ chatbot for new students joining your college.

Requirements:
- Answer top 50 common questions
- Work on mobile
- Fast responses
- Support both text and voice input

Limits:
- 4 weeks
- All team members are beginners
- No paid tools
- Exams in Week 3
- Only 8-10 hours per week per person

5.1 Which requirements are easy or realistic? Which are difficult or unrealistic? Why?
5.2 Choose the top three features to build first and explain why these matter most.
5.3 Create a practical 4-week work plan based on your limits.
5.4 After two weeks, you realize you are behind schedule. What will you do now? Write a practical backup plan.
5.5 New change: The college wants voice input for accessibility within 2 weeks after launch.
    You cannot add time or people. What do you change, what do you record, and how will you roll back if it fails?

Section 6 - Quick Learning Challenge
Time: 25 minutes

Read the explanation below:

A "change log" is a history where every change is recorded as a new line.
The current state can be rebuilt by replaying the log.
If you need to undo a change, you add another line that reverses it instead of deleting history.
This makes changes traceable and reversible.

6.1 Explain this idea in simple words to a friend who is not from computer science.
6.2 Give two real-life situations where this idea could be useful.
6.3 Write what parts of this idea are still unclear to you.
6.4 Write one experiment or thought experiment you could do to understand it better.

Section 7 - Reflection
Time: 10 minutes

R.1 Which section felt easiest for you? Why?
R.2 Which section felt hardest? Why?
R.3 If you had to attempt this paper again, what would you change in your approach?
