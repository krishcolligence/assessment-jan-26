# R&D Engineering Aptitude Test - Scoring Guide (Revised)

Scoring scale per section:
4 - Exceptional
3 - Strong
2 - Adequate
1 - Weak

Global dimension:
Clear articulation is scored across all sections (1-4) and should be applied consistently.

---

Section 1 - Modeling a Messy Narrative
Primary traits: Modeling from Narrative, Dependency and Ripple Reasoning

4 - Exceptional
- Clear list of entities and roles (people, items, records).
- Rules and constraints are explicit, non-overlapping.
- Flow covers request, approval, pickup, return, and exceptions.
- Ripple effects include second-order impacts (waitlist, fines, audit trail, approvals).

3 - Strong
- Good structure and flow.
- Some rules or ripple effects missing.

2 - Adequate
- Partial list, weak structure, minimal ripple thinking.

1 - Weak
- Restates narrative with little structure.

---

Section 2 - Information Synthesis
Primary traits: Modeling from Narrative, Prioritization

4 - Exceptional
- Identifies agreements and contradictions clearly.
- Resolves constraints with a feasible plan.
- Solution integrates all sources.
- Includes a meaningful metric and good missing info.

3 - Strong
- Good synthesis, reasonable solution.
- Metric or missing info is basic.

2 - Adequate
- Mostly restates data, weak linkage to solution.

1 - Weak
- No synthesis or plan.

---

Section 3 - Pattern Recognition
Primary trait: Pattern Recognition

4 - Exceptional
- Abstract pattern stated cleanly.
- Correctly applies to the cafeteria scenario with a plausible solution.

3 - Strong
- Correct pattern, reasonable application.

2 - Adequate
- Pattern partially correct or vague.

1 - Weak
- Misses the underlying pattern.

---

Section 4 - Diagnostic Reasoning
Primary trait: Diagnostic Reasoning

4 - Exceptional
- Multiple hypotheses across categories.
- Tests isolate single variables.
- Clear strategy to converge on root cause.

3 - Strong
- Good hypotheses, tests mostly clean.

2 - Adequate
- Generic causes, weak test isolation.

1 - Weak
- Few causes, unclear tests.

---

Section 5 - Prioritization and Change Governance
Primary traits: Prioritization, Change Governance Mindset

4 - Exceptional
- Clear trade-offs and realistic plan.
- Backup plan shows scope reduction and dependency awareness.
- Change response includes traceability, rollback, and impact boundary.

3 - Strong
- Good prioritization and plan.
- Change response covers some governance elements.

2 - Adequate
- Over-optimistic plan, weak governance thinking.

1 - Weak
- No prioritization or unrealistic plan.

---

Section 6 - Rapid Domain Learning
Primary traits: Rapid Domain Learning, Clear Articulation

4 - Exceptional
- Simple, correct explanation in own words.
- Two useful real-life examples.
- Honest unknowns and a sensible experiment.

3 - Strong
- Correct explanation, examples are basic.

2 - Adequate
- Parrots text without insight.

1 - Weak
- Incorrect or unclear explanation.

---

Section 7 - Reflective Thinking
Primary trait: Reflective Thinking

4 - Exceptional
- Specific insight into own thinking.
- Clear change in approach next time.

3 - Strong
- Reasonable reflection, some specificity.

2 - Adequate
- Generic reflection.

1 - Weak
- No real insight.

---

Clear Articulation (Global)
4 - Exceptional: structured, concise, logical, easy to follow.
3 - Strong: mostly clear, minor issues.
2 - Adequate: understandable but messy.
1 - Weak: hard to follow.

---

Scoring note:
Reserve "4" for answers that show second-order reasoning, explicit assumptions, and clean test design. This keeps score gaps wide enough to separate exceptional candidates from average ones.
