| **Total Score** |  |  | **/32**     |

**Final Band:**

* 28–32 → *Exceptional — strong fit for Foundry R&D*
* 22–27 → *Strong — likely good fit, verify gaps in F2F*
* 16–21 → *Adequate — significant gaps, needs strong F2F performance*
* <16 → *Weak — not recommended*

**Minimum Thresholds:**
* Foundation traits (S1, S4): Must score 2+ on both
* Change Governance (S5.5): Must score 2+
* No section should score 1

## **Section-wise Evaluation Notes**

### **S1. Understanding How Work Happens**
**Traits:** Modeling from Narrative (primary), Dependency & Ripple Reasoning (secondary)

*(Evaluate: entities identified (explicit + implicit), process flow extraction, dependency rule articulation, ripple effects across multiple actors, traceability thinking. Exceptional candidates see the system, not just the story.)*

### **S2. Information Synthesis**
**Traits:** Modeling from Narrative (primary), Prioritization (secondary)

*(Evaluate: synthesis across sources (not just summary), creative reframing of contradictions, solution addresses all stakeholders, missing information is actionable.)*

### **S3. Finding Patterns**
**Traits:** Pattern Recognition (primary), Dependency & Ripple Reasoning (secondary)

*(Evaluate: pattern abstracted in domain-independent language, correct application to new situations, distinguishes temporal vs informational patterns in 3.4.)*

### **S4. Diagnostic Reasoning**
**Traits:** Diagnostic Reasoning

*(Evaluate: 5+ diverse hypotheses spanning categories (hardware, software, environment), tests isolate single variables, clear root cause narrowing strategy.)*

### **S5. Prioritization & Change Governance**
**Traits:** Prioritization Under Constraints (5.1–5.4), Change Governance Mindset (5.5)

*(5.1–5.4: Realistic feasibility assessment, clear rationale, practical plan respecting constraints, adaptable backup.)*

*(5.5: Approach choice with trade-off reasoning, specific data needed for tracing, fix addresses all three requirements—stop harm, identify affected, prevent recurrence.)*

### **S6. Rapid Domain Learning**
**Traits:** Rapid Domain Learning (primary), Reflective Thinking (secondary)

*(Evaluate: explanation uses novel apt analogy (not restating example), non-obvious applications with clear reasoning, genuine unclear parts identified, specific connection to Section 1.)*

### **S7. Reflection**
**Traits:** Reflective Thinking

*(Evaluate: specific insight into own cognition (not just task difficulty), articulates explicit method, concrete actionable improvement, awareness of connections between sections.)*

### **Global. Clear Articulation**
**Traits:** Clear Articulation (applied across entire test)

*(Evaluate: structured answers (headers, bullets, logical flow), complex ideas explained simply, appropriate detail level, concrete examples used effectively.)*

## **Strengths**

*(3–5 short, specific bullets generated by AI)*

**Exceptional Candidate Markers (if applicable):**
- S1 score of 4 (strongest signal for Foundry fit)
- Connections between sections (e.g., 6.4 references S1, 7.4 shows integration)
- Spontaneous governance thinking before S5.5

---

## **Concerns / Weaknesses**

*(3–5 short bullets; focus on reasoning gaps or risks)*

**Red Flags to Note:**
- Retelling story instead of extracting structure (S1)
- Only thinks about happy path in governance (S5.5)
- No traceability thinking
- Labels without reasoning in reflection (S7)

## **Final Recommendation (AI Generated)**

* **Exceptional** / **Strong** / **Adequate** / **Weak**
  *(Choose one and justify in 2–3 lines.)*
