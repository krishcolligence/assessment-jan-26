SECTION 1 – Understanding How Work Happens

1.1 Core business objects
- Customers
- Catering business owners
- Orders
- Event
- Event database
- Guest count
- Menu
- Dishes
- Price estimate
- Final price

Planning & coordination objects
- Delivery / availability calendar date
- Order record / notes
- Menu plan
- Shopping list
- Ingredients / items to buy

People
- Cook
- Helpers
- Delivery

Execution
- Prepared food
- Delivery
- Event date

Payment
- Payment
- Payment method (advance, on delivery, monthly)
- Payment record
- Payment book

Control
- Order ID
- Customer details
- Change requests

1.2 Events
1. Customer calls to inquire
2. Customer provides event details
3. Owner checks availability dates
4. Order accepted or rejected
5. Order details (number of people, date etc.)
6. Price calculated & shared
7. Menu created
8. Shopping list created
9. Customer requests changes
10. Order details updated
11. Cook updates menu
12. Helper goes shopping
13. Event day preparation
14. Delivery
15. Payment received

1.3 Dependency violation
When guest contacts to change the order details at the last minute, menu and shopping list must be updated before shopping.

Downstream effects
- Food quantity changes
- Shopping list changes
- Estimated price changes
- Delivery quantity changes

1.4 Each shopping list must include
- Order ID
- Customer name
- Event date
- Guest count
- Quantity of items
- Total price

Each shopping list must represent a single order and every order generates its own shopping list.

SECTION 2 – Understanding & Combining Information

2.1 Argument
- Delay in bus
- Evening demand is more
- Current system is not good or efficient

Disagreement
- Students want more buses but real-time tracking
- College admin says budget cannot be increased
- GPS tracking pilot was done but discontinued (only 10% buses had it)
- Drivers say heavy traffic and ID scanner delay, poor routing

2.2
- Allocate buses from morning empty buses to evening demand
- Reschedule buses based on demand pattern
- Reduce delays by improving boarding speed

2.3
1. Demand-based scheduling
2. Operational improvement
   - Use routes with less traffic
   - Speed up ID scanning
3. Instead of real-time tracking, use scale & time based approach to give estimated arrival time

2.4
- Use empty buses in morning routes to areas where students stay
- Use dashboards and mobile checklist for drivers

SECTION 3 – Finding Patterns

3.1 Common patterns
- Usage is not evenly distributed
- Sometimes same resources used at the same time

3.2 When many people use shared resources at same time, it is a pattern

3.3 Cafeteria example
- Students come at same time from different sections
- Cafeteria looks empty otherwise
Solutions
- Extend serving hours
- Different lunch timings for departments

3.4 Communication issues due to lack of real-time information sharing

SECTION 4 – Figuring out why something is wrong

4.1 System depends on device clock
- App slowdown on heavy processing
- App calculating seconds incorrectly

4.2 Checks
- Compare system clock with external stopwatch
- Check CPU load
- Use start & end timestamps

4.3 Run tests multiple times and compare results

SECTION 5 – Working with limits & choosing what matters

Easy
- Answer top 30 questions
- Static, well-defined
- Web based, fast response

Difficult
- Text & voice input
- Requires speech recognition

5.2
- Mobile web based implementation
- Scope-controlled answers
- Text based FAQ

5.3 Weekly plan
Week 1: Collect questions & answers, decide format & UI flow
Week 2: Implement logic & interface, keyword matching
Week 3: Exams ongoing, bug fixes
Week 4: Improve based on feedback & deploy

5.4 Focus only on core features
- Stability over completeness
- Remove features if needed

5.5 Quality checks
- Answer only when confident
- Track questions, keywords, answers
- Check FAQ database
- Review & flag wrong answers
- Maintain history

SECTION 6 – Quick Learning Challenge

6.1 To-do list approach instead of instructions

6.2 Examples
- Online food order flow
- College attendance flow

6.3 Decide how long history should be stored

6.4 Event usage flow
- Event created
- Guest updated
- Menu updated
- Shopping list created
- Shopping complete

SECTION 7 – Reflection

7.1 Section 3 was easiest

7.2 Sections 5 & 6 were hardest

7.3 Broke business into parts
- People
- Events
- Information
- Changes

7.4 With more time, would improve understanding and efficiency
