## Recommendations

### Ravi Krishna (20/32 — Adequate)
- **Proceed to F2F:** Yes, with reservations
- **Areas to probe in interview:**
  - Diagnostic reasoning depth: Can they systematically isolate root causes?
  - Domain learning: How do they approach truly unfamiliar concepts? Do they recognize what they don't know?
  - Scope management: Tendency to over-engineer suggests potential difficulty in constrained environments
  - Reflective capacity: Can they articulate their thinking process with specificity?

## Notes

- Single candidate evaluated in this batch
- Candidate meets all minimum thresholds
- No exceptional markers present
- Primary concern: Gap between foundational sections (S1-S3 at 3) and analytical sections (S4, S6, S7 at 2)
