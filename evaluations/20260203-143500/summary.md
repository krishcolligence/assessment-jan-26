## Ranking Table

| Rank | Name | Score | Band | Key Strengths | Key Concerns |
|------|------|-------|------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | Ravi Krishna | 23/32 | Strong | Creative problem reframing; Explicit process framework; Cross-section integration (6.4→S1); Practical phased thinking | Limited diagnostic breadth (4 hypotheses); Overclaims understanding (6.3); Chose riskier governance option without full justification |
| 2 | Ashwath Ravindra Bhat | 17/32 | Adequate | Excellent systematic categorization (S1); Comprehensive event listing; Practical solutions | Consistent under-explanation; Synthesis weakness; Incomplete governance response; No reflective reasoning |

## Section-wise Comparison

| Section | Ravi Krishna | Ashwath Bhat | Notes |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| S1. Modeling from Narrative | 3 | 3 | Both strong; Ashwath better categorization, Ravi better implicit entity identification |
| S2. Information Synthesis | 3 | 2 | Ravi shows creative reframing; Ashwath lists without synthesizing |
| S3. Pattern Recognition | 3 | 2 | Ravi abstracts better; neither distinguishes temporal vs informational patterns |
| S4. Diagnostic Reasoning | 2 | 2 | Both at minimum; limited hypothesis diversity |
| S5. Prioritization & Governance | 3 | 2 | Ravi addresses governance requirements; Ashwath incomplete |
| S6. Rapid Domain Learning | 3 | 2 | Ravi provides clear analogy and S1 connection; Ashwath vague |
| S7. Reflective Thinking | 3 | 2 | Ravi articulates method; Ashwath provides no reasoning |
| Global. Clear Articulation | 3 | 2 | Ravi well-structured with examples; Ashwath under-explained |

## Recommendations

### Ravi Krishna — **Proceed to F2F**
- **Band:** Strong (23/32)
- **F2F Focus Areas:**
  1. Diagnostic methodology: How does he isolate root cause among multiple hypotheses?
  2. Intellectual humility: Probe areas where he claims full understanding
  3. Pattern abstraction: Can he distinguish temporal vs informational contention verbally?

### Ashwath Ravindra Bhat — **Conditional F2F**
- **Band:** Adequate (17/32)
- **Condition:** Only if strong F2F performance expected based on other factors (resume, referral, etc.)
- **F2F Focus Areas:**
  1. Reasoning depth: Are brief answers due to time pressure or surface engagement?
  2. Synthesis ability: Can he reconcile contradictory information verbally?
  3. Governance scenarios: Test proactive thinking about failure modes and affected users

## Methodology Notes

- **Evaluation approach:** Section-by-section batch scoring with rubric criteria restated, followed by global articulation assessment, cross-check, threshold verification, and pairwise comparison
- **Scoring:** 1-4 scale only, no half points; all sections weighted equally (4 pts × 8 = 32)
- **Evidence:** All scores backed by specific candidate quotes where available
- **Limitations:** Written test only; verbal articulation and interactive problem-solving not assessed
