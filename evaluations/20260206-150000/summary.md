## Ranking Table

| Rank | Name | S1 | S2 | S3 | S4 | S5 | S6 | S7 | Global | Score/32 | Band | Key Strengths | Key Concerns |
|------|------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|--------|----------|------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | Ravi Krishna | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 3 | **22** | Strong | Consistent product thinking; creative problem reframing; strong governance in S5.5 (addresses all 3 fix requirements) | Claims "no questions" in S6.3; weak reflection (S7); overly ambitious plans vs constraints |
| 2 | Ashwath Bhat | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | **17** | Adequate | Exceptional S1 (best in cohort — structured categorization of 20+ entities); correct governance instinct (chooses option iii) | **S7=1 threshold violation**; severe brevity S2–S7; inaccurate event sourcing analogy; no cross-section connections |

## Exceptional Candidate Markers

| Marker | Ravi Krishna | Ashwath Bhat |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| S1 score of 4 | No (3) | **Yes** |
| Cross-section connections | Partial (S6.4→S1 table, but claims ES won't help mixed lists) | No |
| Spontaneous governance thinking before S5.5 | No | No |

## Head-to-Head Notes

- **Score gap:** 5 points (22 vs 17) — significant separation, no pairwise ambiguity
- **Ashwath's S1 is the strongest single-section performance** in this cohort (4/4), which is the highest-signal section for Foundry R&D fit. This deserves attention despite the overall lower score.
- **Ravi's consistency** (five sections at 3, two at 2) vs **Ashwath's variance** (one section at 4, five at 2, one at 1) represents two different profiles:
  - Ravi: Reliable mid-to-strong performer across diverse problem types
  - Ashwath: Exceptional at structured decomposition but struggles with synthesis, abstraction, and reflective articulation
- **Ashwath's brevity pattern** (exceptional S1 then thin S2–S7) may reflect time management — possibly spent too long on S1. F2F should probe whether later sections represent capability limits or time pressure.

## Recommendations

### Ravi Krishna — **Recommend for F2F**
Strong overall. Explore in F2F: (1) intellectual humility and comfort with uncertainty (probed by S6.3 "no questions" response), (2) depth of meta-cognitive/reflective thinking, (3) calibrating ambition against real constraints.

### Ashwath Bhat — **Conditional F2F (if S1 performance is weighted heavily)**
Threshold violation (S7=1) would normally disqualify. However, the exceptional S1 score is a strong positive signal for Foundry R&D. If F2F is pursued, it should specifically probe: (1) whether brevity reflects time pressure vs reasoning limits, (2) verbal ability to synthesize and articulate trade-offs, (3) reflective thinking in conversation.
