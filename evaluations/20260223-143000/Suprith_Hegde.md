**Final Band:** Weak — not recommended

**Minimum Thresholds:**
* Foundation traits (S1=1, S4=1): **FAIL** (both below 2)
* Change Governance (S5.5): **FAIL** (no governance answer)
* No section scores 1: **FAIL** (seven sections score 1)

**AI-determined Band:** Weak

**Important Note:** This candidate's answer sheet appears to be a converted/summarized transcript and is the most abbreviated of all submissions. Nearly every section is 1-2 lines. This evaluation is based on the available text, which may substantially underrepresent the candidate's actual responses.

## **Section-wise Evaluation Notes**

### **S1. Understanding How Work Happens**
**Score: 1 | Traits:** Modeling from Narrative (primary), Dependency & Ripple Reasoning (secondary)

Lists 6 entities: Event date, Guest count, Menu, Diary, Price, Shopping list. Only explicit items. No people/roles listed (no customer, cook, helper, driver).

No events listed. No process flow.

Dependency: "Guest count changed but cook not informed → food shortage." Restates the problem from the passage. Not articulated as a rule ("When X happens, Y must happen"). Only one downstream effect (food shortage).

No answer for 1.4 (shopping list information/linking).

**Why 1:** Entities are below threshold (6 items, no roles/people). No events extracted. Dependency is a restatement, not a rule. One effect only. No linking answer.

### **S2. Information Synthesis**
**Score: 1 | Traits:** Modeling from Narrative (primary), Prioritization (secondary)

"Bus GPS issues, traffic delays, budget constraints. Solutions: increase buses, improve GPS tracking, crowd management."

"Increase buses" directly contradicts the budget constraint from Source B — doesn't handle the contradiction. No synthesis of agreements/disagreements. No missing information.

**Why 1:** No synthesis. Solution contradicts stated constraints. No contradiction handling.

### **S3. Finding Patterns**
**Score: 2 | Traits:** Pattern Recognition (primary), Dependency & Ripple Reasoning (secondary)

"Common pattern: peak usage slowdown. Examples: gym crowd, printer queue, cafeteria seating."

Identifies the pattern correctly. Lists examples including cafeteria, which addresses 3.3. However, all examples are from the question itself — doesn't demonstrate transfer to a new situation, just re-listing. No 3.4 answer.

**Why 2:** Pattern identified at surface level. Examples re-list what's given rather than showing independent application. No 3.4.

### **S4. Diagnostic Reasoning**
**Score: 1 | Traits:** Diagnostic Reasoning

"Timer app bug due to timestamp errors."

One hypothesis. No test design. No root cause strategy.

**Why 1:** Single vague hypothesis. No tests. No strategy.

### **S5. Prioritization & Change Governance**
**Score: 1 | Traits:** Prioritization Under Constraints (5.1–5.4), Change Governance Mindset (5.5)

"Realistic features: FAQ answers, fast response, mobile support. Unrealistic: voice input, paid tools, beginner team limits."

Basic feasibility assessment only. "Paid tools" as unrealistic is correct (constraint says no paid tools). But no feature priorities, no plan, no backup, no governance.

**Why 1:** Only 5.1 partially addressed. No plan, priorities, or governance content.

### **S6. Rapid Domain Learning**
**Score: 1 | Traits:** Rapid Domain Learning (primary), Reflective Thinking (secondary)

"Bank account history tracking example."

Restates the example provided in the passage. No original explanation, no new applications, no unclear parts, no S1 connection.

**Why 1:** Only repeats the given example. No evidence of understanding or ability to apply the concept.

### **S7. Reflection**
**Score: 1 | Traits:** Reflective Thinking

"Reflection notes."

No actual reflection content.

**Why 1:** No content.

### **Global. Clear Articulation**
**Score: 1 | Traits:** Clear Articulation (applied across entire test)

The most abbreviated submission in the cohort. Nearly every section is 1-2 lines. Impossible to assess communication quality when so little is communicated.

---

## **Strengths**

- Correctly identifies the peak usage pattern (S3)
- Correctly notes "paid tools" as a constraint violation (S5)
- Identifies the core S1 dependency issue (cook not informed)

**Exceptional Candidate Markers (if applicable):**
- None triggered

---

## **Concerns / Weaknesses**

- Seven sections score 1 — the weakest submission in the cohort
- Both foundation traits (S1, S4) below minimum threshold
- No governance content
- S1 doesn't list any people/roles as entities
- S2 solution contradicts stated constraints
- S6 only repeats the given example
- No reflection content

**Red Flags to Note:**
- Most abbreviated submission — possible significant content loss in conversion
- Even at face value, the S2 contradiction (proposing to increase buses despite budget constraint) suggests weak analytical engagement

---

## **Final Recommendation (AI Generated)**

* **Weak** — Suprith's submission is the sparsest in the cohort, with seven sections scoring 1 and both foundation trait thresholds unmet. The available text shows minimal analytical engagement. Not recommended for advancement. **Caveat:** This is the strongest case for potential conversion/transcription loss affecting the evaluation. If the original submission was substantially more detailed, a re-evaluation with complete materials is strongly recommended.
