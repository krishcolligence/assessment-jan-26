*Asterisk indicates candidate submission appears to be a converted/summarized transcript. Original responses may have contained substantially more content. Re-evaluation with original materials is recommended if available.

## Minimum Threshold Check

| Candidate | S1 ≥ 2 | S4 ≥ 2 | S5.5 Gov ≥ 2 | No 1-scores | Threshold Pass |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Ravi Krishna | 3 PASS | 3 PASS | 3 PASS | PASS | **PASS** |
| Ashwath Bhat | 3 PASS | 2 PASS | 3 PASS | PASS | **PASS** |
| Aryan Khaire | 2 PASS | 2 PASS | 2 PASS | PASS | **PASS** |
| Pritam Wankhede | 2 PASS | 2 PASS | 2 PASS | S3,S6,S7=1 | **FAIL** |
| Narayan Hegde | 2 PASS | 1 FAIL | 1 FAIL | S4-S7,G=1 | **FAIL** |
| Shreyas Reddy | 2 PASS | 1 FAIL | 1 FAIL | S2,S4,S5,S7,G=1 | **FAIL** |
| Hemanth Turkani | 2 PASS | 1 FAIL | 1 FAIL | S2,S4-S7,G=1 | **FAIL** |
| Suprith Hegde | 1 FAIL | 1 FAIL | 1 FAIL | S1,S2,S4-S7,G=1 | **FAIL** |

## Exceptional Candidate Markers

| Marker | Ravi Krishna | Ashwath Bhat | Others |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| S1 score of 4 (strongest Foundry signal) | No (S1=3) | No (S1=3) | No |
| Cross-section connections (6.4→S1, 7.4 integration) | Partial — 6.4 builds event table for S1 catering; 7.4 connects S4 difficulty to specific improvement | Partial — 6.4 lists S1-relevant events | No |
| Spontaneous governance thinking before S5.5 | No | No | No |

No candidate achieves the exceptional marker trifecta. Ravi Krishna comes closest with partial cross-section connections.

## Pairwise Sanity Check (candidates within 2 points)

### Narayan (11) vs Shreyas (11)
Both score 11 but with different profiles:
- **Narayan** is stronger in S2 (redistribution + multi-source solutions) and S1 (broader downstream effects)
- **Shreyas** is stronger in S6 (Git history analogy shows technical instinct) and has slightly better S3 phrasing
- Both are severely hampered by sparse submissions in later sections
- **Verdict:** Effectively tied. Both weak with different bright spots.

### Hemanth (10) vs Narayan/Shreyas (11)
- Hemanth has marginally less content across all sections
- S1 is comparable across all three
- **Verdict:** Hemanth slightly weaker, consistent with 1-point gap.

### Suprith (9) vs Hemanth (10)
- Suprith's S1 scores 1 (no roles/people listed) vs Hemanth's S1 at 2
- Both equally sparse elsewhere
- **Verdict:** Suprith slightly weaker, consistent with 1-point gap.

## Cohort-Level Observations

1. **Clear separation between top 3 and bottom 5:** Ravi (26), Ashwath (21), and Aryan (16) all pass minimum thresholds; the remaining 5 candidates all fail multiple thresholds.

2. **Conversion/transcription quality is a significant confound:** Four candidates (Hemanth, Narayan, Shreyas, Suprith) have answers that appear to be abbreviated summaries rather than original responses. Their scores may not accurately reflect actual capability. If original submissions exist, re-evaluation is strongly recommended.

3. **No exceptional performers:** No candidate scores in the 28-32 range. Even the strongest candidate (Ravi, 26) has identifiable gaps.

4. **S4 (Diagnostic Reasoning) is the weakest section overall:** Only Ravi achieves a 3; most candidates score 1-2. This suggests either the question is particularly difficult or the cohort lacks systematic debugging/hypothesis-testing skills.

5. **Governance thinking (S5.5) is rare:** Only Ravi and Ashwath demonstrate meaningful governance awareness. This is a critical gap for R&D roles.

6. **Reflection (S7) is universally weak:** Only Ravi achieves a 3. Most candidates cannot articulate their own thinking processes, suggesting limited metacognitive development.

## Recommendations

| Candidate | Recommendation | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **Ravi Krishna** | **Advance to F2F** | Probe: constraint internalization, intellectual humility, team collaboration with beginners |
| **Ashwath Bhat** | **Advance to F2F (conditional)** | Probe: diagnostic reasoning depth, learning approach for unfamiliar concepts, self-awareness |
| **Aryan Khaire** | **Borderline — F2F if pipeline needs candidates** | Probe: whether surface-level pattern is due to time pressure or natural depth |
| Pritam Wankhede | Do not advance | Fundamental gaps in abstraction and domain learning |
| Narayan Hegde | Do not advance (or re-evaluate with original) | Insufficient evidence; may warrant re-evaluation if original submission is available |
| Shreyas Reddy | Do not advance (or re-evaluate with original) | Insufficient evidence; Git history analogy suggests possible hidden capability |
| Hemanth Turkani | Do not advance (or re-evaluate with original) | Insufficient evidence |
| Suprith Hegde | Do not advance (or re-evaluate with original) | Insufficient evidence |
