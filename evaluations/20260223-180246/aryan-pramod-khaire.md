| **Total Score** |  |  | **16/32** |

**Final Band:** Adequate

- 28-32 -> Exceptional - strong fit for Foundry R&D
- 22-27 -> Strong - likely good fit, verify gaps in F2F
- 16-21 -> Adequate - significant gaps, needs strong F2F performance
- <16 -> Weak - not recommended

**AI-determined Band:** Adequate

**Threshold Check:** Fail (S5.5=1; governance minimum not met)

## Section-wise Evaluation Notes

### S1. Understanding How Work Happens
**Score: 2**
- Captures some entities and flow, but model is mostly explicit and misses key implicit controls.
- Dependency statement is generic ("Dependency is functional dependency") instead of a precise rule.
- Traceability idea exists via unique IDs.

### S2. Information Synthesis
**Score: 2**
- Provides partial synthesis (rerouting and evening focus), but agreement/disagreement mapping is incomplete.
- Some recommendations conflict with constraints ("Increase budget").
- Missing-information list is weakly actionable.

### S3. Finding Patterns
**Score: 2**
- Correctly identifies peak-load contention pattern.
- Generalization is basic and solution depth is limited.
- Fest case is reduced to "Race condition" without clear informational-flow distinction.

### S4. Diagnostic Reasoning
**Score: 2**
- Gives four plausible engineering causes.
- Test descriptions are broad and not tightly isolated per hypothesis.
- Root-cause narrowing method is minimal.

### S5. Prioritization & Change Governance
**Score: 2**
- Prioritization includes core FAQ/text focus but plan quality is uneven for beginner constraints.
- Governance choice is quick-response plus flagging with limited risk-control reasoning.
- Tracing and prevention details are underdeveloped.

### S6. Rapid Domain Learning
**Score: 2**
- Explanation stays close to provided bank framing rather than new analogy.
- Some useful application attempts (crime scene, crash logs), but reasoning is shallow.
- 6.3 says "All parts of idea clear," limiting reflective learning evidence.

### S7. Reflection
**Score: 2**
- Basic easy/hard self-assessment is present.
- Process description is brief ("Read paragraph multiple times and visualize").
- Improvement action is generic (attempt easier sections first).

### Global. Clear Articulation
**Score: 2**
- Understandable but unevenly structured and compressed in key areas.
- Core intent is visible, but rationale depth is limited.

---

## Strengths

- Covers all sections with direct responses.
- Shows baseline process/pattern awareness.
- Includes basic traceability idea in S1.4.

**Exceptional Candidate Markers (if applicable):**
- None observed

---

## Concerns / Weaknesses

- S5.5 governance threshold not met (insufficient tracing and prevention detail).
- Multiple sections remain at surface-level abstraction.
- Limited cross-section integration and reflective depth.

**Red Flags to Note:**
- Governance thinking is reactive rather than preventive

---

## Final Recommendation (AI Generated)

- **Adequate**
Candidate demonstrates baseline reasoning but lacks depth in governance and diagnostic rigor expected for stronger fit. Consider only with strong interview evidence on structured thinking and safe change practices.
