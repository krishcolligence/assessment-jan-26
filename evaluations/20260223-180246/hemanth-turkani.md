**Final Band:** Weak

- 28-32 -> Exceptional - strong fit for Foundry R&D
- 22-27 -> Strong - likely good fit, verify gaps in F2F
- 16-21 -> Adequate - significant gaps, needs strong F2F performance
- <16 -> Weak - not recommended

**AI-determined Band:** Weak

**Threshold Check:** Fail (S4<2, S5.5=1, multiple sections scored 1)

## Section-wise Evaluation Notes

### S1. Understanding How Work Happens
**Score: 2**
- Provides a basic list of actors, artifacts, and rough process sequence.
- Mentions structural issues such as missing order ID/labels.
- Coverage is too compressed for stronger rubric levels.

### S2. Information Synthesis
**Score: 1**
- Only high-level issue labels are provided; no full agreement/disagreement synthesis.

### S3. Finding Patterns
**Score: 1**
- Pattern mention is present but not developed into the required abstraction/transfer answers.

### S4. Diagnostic Reasoning
**Score: 1**
- Gives minimal causes without hypothesis breadth, tests, or isolation strategy.

### S5. Prioritization & Change Governance
**Score: 1**
- Feature and timeline references are too brief for evaluable prioritization/governance quality.

### S6. Rapid Domain Learning
**Score: 1**
- Examples are listed but conceptual explanation and Section 1 linkage are not demonstrated.

### S7. Reflection
**Score: 1**
- Reflection is too brief to show cognitive-method insight.

### Global. Clear Articulation
**Score: 1**
- Submission is concise but lacks sufficient structure and evidence depth for clarity scoring.

---

## Strengths

- Basic process awareness in S1.
- Mentions traceability problem (missing IDs/labels).

**Exceptional Candidate Markers (if applicable):**
- None observed

---

## Concerns / Weaknesses

- Most sections are incomplete versus prompt demands.
- Diagnostic, governance, and reflective traits are below threshold.
- Minimal evidence-backed reasoning across responses.

**Red Flags to Note:**
- Frequent summary-only responses without reasoning steps

---

## Final Recommendation (AI Generated)

- **Weak**
Submission does not meet minimum evaluation thresholds. Consider only if a complete and substantially stronger follow-up assessment is available.
