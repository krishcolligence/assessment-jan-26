| **Total Score** |  |  | **10/32** |

**Final Band:** Weak

- 28-32 -> Exceptional - strong fit for Foundry R&D
- 22-27 -> Strong - likely good fit, verify gaps in F2F
- 16-21 -> Adequate - significant gaps, needs strong F2F performance
- <16 -> Weak - not recommended

**AI-determined Band:** Weak

**Threshold Check:** Fail (S4<2, S5.5=1, multiple sections scored 1)

## Section-wise Evaluation Notes

### S1. Understanding How Work Happens
**Score: 2**
- Lists core entities and basic order flow.
- Includes downstream effects for guest-count changes.
- Limited dependency formalization and traceability detail.

### S2. Information Synthesis
**Score: 2**
- Provides practical operational suggestions (reallocation, frequency, routing, scanning).
- Does not explicitly synthesize agreement/disagreement across all sources.
- Missing-information reasoning is absent.

### S3. Finding Patterns
**Score: 1**
- Only a short pattern label is provided; required transfer/application details are missing.

### S4. Diagnostic Reasoning
**Score: 1**
- Provides only a minimal cause hint without hypothesis set or isolating tests.

### S5. Prioritization & Change Governance
**Score: 1**
- High-level mention of a beginner FAQ plan without concrete prioritization/governance handling.

### S6. Rapid Domain Learning
**Score: 1**
- Does not provide explanation, applications, unclear parts, or S1 linkage expected by rubric.

### S7. Reflection
**Score: 1**
- Reflection details are not provided in evaluable form.

### Global. Clear Articulation
**Score: 1**
- Submission is too brief to demonstrate structured reasoning across prompts.

---

## Strengths

- Shows baseline understanding of catering flow and peak-demand transport issues.
- Suggests practical bus operations changes in S2.

**Exceptional Candidate Markers (if applicable):**
- None observed

---

## Concerns / Weaknesses

- Most sections are incomplete relative to prompt requirements.
- Diagnostic and governance reasoning thresholds are not met.
- Insufficient evidence of pattern transfer and reflective thinking.

**Red Flags to Note:**
- Answers frequently collapse to summary labels without method/rationale

---

## Final Recommendation (AI Generated)

- **Weak**
Submission is substantially below threshold for this assessment. Major gaps exist in completeness, structure, and multi-step reasoning needed for R&D aptitude.
