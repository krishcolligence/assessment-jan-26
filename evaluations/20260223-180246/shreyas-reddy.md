| **Total Score** |  |  | **9/32** |

**Final Band:** Weak

- 28-32 -> Exceptional - strong fit for Foundry R&D
- 22-27 -> Strong - likely good fit, verify gaps in F2F
- 16-21 -> Adequate - significant gaps, needs strong F2F performance
- <16 -> Weak - not recommended

**AI-determined Band:** Weak

**Threshold Check:** Fail (S4<2, S5.5=1, multiple sections scored 1)

## Section-wise Evaluation Notes

### S1. Understanding How Work Happens
**Score: 2**
- Lists key entities and a basic process path from call to payment.
- Mentions dependency chain and guest-count impact.
- Missing detailed traceability and rule-level dependency articulation.

### S2. Information Synthesis
**Score: 1**
- Provides short issue/solution bullets only; lacks structured cross-source synthesis.

### S3. Finding Patterns
**Score: 1**
- Pattern label is present, but required generalization and transfer analysis are not provided.

### S4. Diagnostic Reasoning
**Score: 1**
- Response is off-target (communication gap between fest roles) instead of timer diagnosis.

### S5. Prioritization & Change Governance
**Score: 1**
- Partial feasibility notes only; no practical plan/governance treatment at rubric depth.

### S6. Rapid Domain Learning
**Score: 1**
- Lists examples without explanation of event-sourcing mechanics or replay logic.

### S7. Reflection
**Score: 1**
- Reflection details are not present in evaluable form.

### Global. Clear Articulation
**Score: 1**
- Too brief and incomplete to support clear articulation scoring above weak.

## Strengths

- Baseline process and dependency awareness in S1.
- Some attempt to provide real-world analogies in S6.

**Exceptional Candidate Markers (if applicable):**
- None observed

---

## Concerns / Weaknesses

- Section 4 answer mismatch indicates prompt-comprehension gap.
- Most sections are under-specified and below threshold.
- Governance, diagnostics, and reflection competencies are not demonstrated.

**Red Flags to Note:**
- Incomplete responses across core reasoning sections

---

## Final Recommendation (AI Generated)

- **Weak**
Candidate response is materially below threshold across core sections. Not recommended based on this submission.
