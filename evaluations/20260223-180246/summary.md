# Candidate Evaluation Summary

**Assessment:** R&D Engineering Aptitude Test (Jan 2026)
**Evaluation Date:** 2026-02-23
**Candidates Evaluated:** 8

## Final Ranking

| Rank | Name | Score/32 | Band | Key Strengths | Key Concerns |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 1 | Ravi Krishna | 26 | Strong | Excellent S1 structural modeling, strong articulation, practical planning | Governance in S5.5 is more reactive than safety-first |
| 2 | Ashwath Ravindra Bhat | 22 | Strong | Strong S1 and solid S2-S3 synthesis, practical scope control | S4 diagnostic depth and S7 reflection specificity |
| 3 | Aryan Pramod Khaire | 16 | Adequate | Covered all sections; baseline process/pattern reasoning | S5.5 governance threshold not met; mostly surface-level depth |
| 4 | Pritam Wankhede | 13 | Weak | Attempted full-paper coverage; basic constraints awareness | Sections S3/S6/S7 at score 1; weak transfer and reflection |
| 5 | Narayan Hegde | 10 | Weak | Basic S1 flow and operational S2 suggestions | Incomplete coverage; multiple threshold failures |
| 6 | Suprith Hegde | 10 | Weak | Basic S1 dependency awareness; correct high-level S3 pattern | Sparse responses; weak diagnostics/governance/learning depth |
| 7 | Hemanth Turkani | 9 | Weak | Basic S1 process capture and traceability mention | Most sections too brief for rubric-level reasoning |
| 8 | Shreyas Reddy | 9 | Weak | Basic S1 structure extraction | Section 4 off-target; broad incompleteness across sections |

## Section-wise Batch Scoring (Phase 1)

| Section | Top Performance | Middle | Lower |
| ------- | --------------- | ------ | ----- |
| S1 | Ravi (4), Ashwath (4) | Aryan/Pritam/Narayan/Suprith/Hemanth/Shreyas (2) | - |
| S2 | Ravi (3), Ashwath (3) | Aryan/Pritam/Narayan (2) | Suprith/Hemanth/Shreyas (1) |
| S3 | Ravi (3), Ashwath (3) | Aryan/Suprith (2) | Pritam/Narayan/Hemanth/Shreyas (1) |
| S4 | Ravi (3) | Ashwath/Aryan/Pritam (2) | Narayan/Suprith/Hemanth/Shreyas (1) |
| S5 | Ravi (3), Ashwath (3) | Aryan/Pritam (2) | Narayan/Suprith/Hemanth/Shreyas (1) |
| S6 | Ravi (3) | Ashwath/Aryan (2) | Pritam/Narayan/Suprith/Hemanth/Shreyas (1) |
| S7 | Ravi (3) | Ashwath/Aryan (2) | Pritam/Narayan/Suprith/Hemanth/Shreyas (1) |
| Global | Ravi (4) | Ashwath (3), Aryan/Pritam (2) | Narayan/Suprith/Hemanth/Shreyas (1) |

## Cross-check (Phase 3)

- Score-to-rationale alignment was reviewed candidate-by-candidate.
- Downward adjustments were applied where answers were summary-only or off-target despite keyword overlap.
- No upward adjustment was made without explicit textual evidence.

## Minimum Threshold Check (Phase 4)

| Candidate | Foundation (S1,S4 >=2) | S5.5 >=2 | No Section = 1 | Result |
| --------- | ---------------------- | -------- | -------------- | ------ |
| Ravi Krishna | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| Ashwath Ravindra Bhat | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| Aryan Pramod Khaire | Pass | **Fail** | Pass | **Fail** |
| Pritam Wankhede | Pass | Pass | **Fail** | **Fail** |
| Narayan Hegde | **Fail** | **Fail** | **Fail** | **Fail** |
| Suprith Hegde | **Fail** | **Fail** | **Fail** | **Fail** |
| Hemanth Turkani | **Fail** | **Fail** | **Fail** | **Fail** |
| Shreyas Reddy | **Fail** | **Fail** | **Fail** | **Fail** |

## Pairwise Sanity Check (Phase 5)

- Narayan (10) vs Suprith (10): Narayan ranked higher due slightly stronger S2 contradiction handling and broader explicit effects in S1.
- Hemanth (9) vs Shreyas (9): Hemanth ranked higher due better section alignment; Shreyas had an off-target S4 response.

## Exceptional Candidate Marker Review

- S1 score of 4: Ravi Krishna, Ashwath Ravindra Bhat.
- Strong cross-section integration (e.g., S6.4 <- S1, S7.4 integration): limited across all candidates.
- Spontaneous governance thinking before S5.5: not clearly evidenced.
