**Final Band:** Weak

- 28-32 -> Exceptional - strong fit for Foundry R&D
- 22-27 -> Strong - likely good fit, verify gaps in F2F
- 16-21 -> Adequate - significant gaps, needs strong F2F performance
- <16 -> Weak - not recommended

**AI-determined Band:** Weak

**Threshold Check:** Fail (S4<2, S5.5=1, multiple sections scored 1)

## Section-wise Evaluation Notes

### S1. Understanding How Work Happens
**Score: 2**
- Identifies a few core objects and the key dependency failure.
- Coverage is partial and does not build a full system model.

### S2. Information Synthesis
**Score: 1**
- High-level issue list is present, but no full contradiction-handling synthesis.

### S3. Finding Patterns
**Score: 2**
- Correctly identifies peak-usage slowdown pattern with examples.
- Missing the deeper 3.4 distinction (temporal vs informational contention).

### S4. Diagnostic Reasoning
**Score: 1**
- Single-cause statement without multi-hypothesis testing plan.

### S5. Prioritization & Change Governance
**Score: 1**
- Basic realistic/unrealistic split only; plan and governance details are not provided.

### S6. Rapid Domain Learning
**Score: 1**
- Restates bank example; does not show new analogy, uncertainty questions, or S1 integration.

### S7. Reflection
**Score: 1**
- Reflection detail not provided in an evaluable format.

### Global. Clear Articulation
**Score: 1**
- Submission is very short and lacks explanatory structure.

---

## Strengths

- Baseline awareness of dependency break in S1.
- Correct high-level pattern recognition in S3.

**Exceptional Candidate Markers (if applicable):**
- None observed

---

## Concerns / Weaknesses

- Diagnostic and governance threshold traits are not demonstrated.
- Sections are mostly summary-level with limited reasoning evidence.
- Reflection and rapid-learning depth are below required level.

**Red Flags to Note:**
- Minimal completeness across prompted sub-questions

---

## Final Recommendation (AI Generated)

- **Weak**
Response does not meet baseline thresholds for this assessment. Significant improvement is needed in completeness and structured reasoning.
