1.1 Technical Issues

1.1.1 Groups of Issues:
- Technical issues in college side
- Development bugs
- Student side issues
- Network issues
- Browser issues at user side
- Hosting services problem

1.2 Technical issues in College Side:
Reasons:
- Every service which is hosted has a limit in how much load it can handle at a time.
- If correct load balancing methods are not used, it might lead to this problem.
- If college used services like AWS or similar.
- Some of servers went offline abruptly.

1.3 Development bugs:
- While developing software there are bugs, then it might lead to failure in file uploading when load is high (although probability is less considering above situations).

2) Student side issues:
- The system used by student is very old then it can lead to this problem due to old RAM & processors / old wifi drivers.
- Student has low computing power due to many background programs executing, causing laggy experience.

3) Network issues:
- If there are network issues in either of both sides, it can cause problem.
- Student has low speed internet (<500 kbps) while uploading.

4) Browser issues at user side:
- Sometimes users use browsers with strict privacy settings which can lead to laggy experience & problem in uploading.
- Eg: Browser with too much adblock & privacy settings (u-block origin).
- Because they sometimes prevent few features of site loading which can cause problem.

5) Hosting services problem:
- If college is using AWS/Azure or similar services, incorrect load balancing settings and network settings while setting up web portal.

Step-by-step plan to diagnose:
- First we need to check system requirements at user side.
- Then particular browser issues (eg: strict privacy).
- Then if it does not work in any browser, check correct network connection.
- Still doesn't work then issue must be in host side.
- Ensure all servers are online.
- Ensure the load balancing policy which is preventing high load.
- Check if there are issues with hosting services if used like AWS.
- Update load balancers and recheck if it can handle load.
- If all of them doesn’t solve then check for any development bugs.

Section 2:

2.1 All three sources agree on:
- Buses are late
- GPS tracking is unsuccessful / need improvement

They disagree on:
- Increasing budget, bus number

2.2 Taking into account that only 10% buses run full and only morning is crowded:
- Reducing bus number in morning
- Increase buses running in evening
- Like splitting buses between morning & evening with correct way

2.3 Balanced Solution:
- Implement GPS with properly working model, learning outcomes from previous failure.
- Planning better routes in both morning & evening.
- Combine 2/3 routes including nearby areas covering more students.
- Thus number of GPS units can be reduced.
- Proper planning and distribution of buses without increasing budget.

2.4 Additional data needed:
1) Why previous GPS failed? Reasons behind it?
2) Exact number of students travelling morning & evening, number of buses running.
3) How did they distribute routes to each bus.

Section 3: Pattern

3.1 Common idea is increased traffic at particular time period.

3.2 When there is high demand for certain things at certain time, then we encounter increase in traffic just around those time periods.

3.3 Average occupancy tells us the collected average during a day, not at a particular time.

- Students encountering scarcity of seats at particular time is due to high demand.

Solutions can be seen in 2 ways:
1) Cab owners providing increased seat capacity or introducing takeovers.
2) Students can prevent this by understanding timing of high traffic & coming early or take own if possible.

Section 4:

4.1 Reasons:
- Not clearing cache of previous timestamps or not handling logic correctly.
- If showing 10 minutes but in reality it is 11 or 9 minutes.
- Some issues with code.
- If some module is imported to implement timer then there can be issues with module.
- Issues with compiler.
- Broken local download of particular imports/packages.

4.2 Solutions:
- If timer is running properly at first, then when again you run at time, it goes wrong if cache is not handled properly.
- Check the logic and if you are using time rounding to 10 mins, ensure UI elements are in sync.
- Reimport modules if used.
- Use different compiler and check.
- Reinstall every package.

4.3 If more than 1 reason possible, then solve each reason one at a time to arrive at root cause.

Section 5:

5.1 Each reason in its own is easy, but if we need everything at once then it is difficult.
- Like fast mobile + top 50 Q so that voice.
- Combination of 2 or more is tough.
- Have to choose between fast response & text voice.

5.2 As students want to solve their doubts, we need:
1) Top 50 common Qs
2) Work on mobile (most of them don’t have PC)
3) Fast responses

5.3 4-Week work plan:

Week 1:
- Research on user needs/expectations
- Finding all information related to the project
- Like top 50 common questions, what devices they use mostly

Week 2:
- Choosing tech stack & working on project (simple prototype)
- Combine existing 3 people in a meeting
- Choose best tech stack based on research
- Working towards learning how to use / implement them in real world
- Making roadmap & structure
- Assigning responsibilities to each based on their strength

Week 3:
- Developing prototype further
- Brainstorm about how we can implement these ideas technically in best possible way
- Choosing only most important features
- Discussing within ourselves

Week 4:
- Deploy & feedback
- Deploy simple most important only feature included model to few people to test
- Gathering feedback and improving with respect to that

5.4 If we are behind after 2 weeks:
- Omit few features based on importance

Revised Plan:
- Build simple prototype with only top 20 common questions & little slow response
- Try to polish at max as team are there

Week 4 (Revised):
- Divide our team & one group will test already developed features
- Other will work on omitted features & try to incorporate
- Take feedback & gradually increase features after deployment

Section 6:

6.1 Bloom filter tells you if something is present or not.
- If it is present then it shows or says in whole array (array = bag of non-ordered storage).
- If there is one zero in bag (array), then item is not present.
- Sometimes it can lie about if item is present, but it never says item is not in bag if it is in bag.

6.2 Real-life scenario:
1) Cancer/disease detection – it doesn’t give false alarm about absence.
2) Spam detection
3) Fraud detection

6.3 Did not understand how this is processed at code level and why it gives false alarm only related to maybe present.

6.4 If we break down as black or white balls:
- Black = present (1), white = not present (0)
- It may find even a single black ball in any case
- Sometimes all white balls even if item is not in set
- Black returns to 1, white returns to 0

Section 7:

R1) Section 3 & 5 felt easiest because section 3 I found pattern & understood it easily and section 5 is something I tried to implement previously.

R2) Section 6 concept was easy, but I couldn't get deep dive due to limited information.

R3) I would revisit in opposite approach to first one, more into technical depth of my answers and try to think of same problem in different perspective.
