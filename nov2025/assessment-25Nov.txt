## **Section 1 — Breaking Down a Complex Problem**

### **Time: 30 minutes**

Your college’s online placement portal has become very slow during placement season. Students report:

* Pages take 8–10 seconds to load
* Sometimes it shows timeout errors
* Resume uploads fail or take too long
* Some students face issues while others don’t

The college wants to understand what might be going wrong.

**1.1** Break down all possible reasons into clear groups (e.g., technical issues, network issues, student-side issues, etc.).

**1.2** For each group, list possible reasons inside it. You may write assumptions if needed.

**1.3** Write a step-by-step plan to check what the real problem is. Each step should check one thing at a time.

## **Section 2 — Understanding and Combining Information**

### **Time: 40 minutes**

Your college wants to improve the bus system. You are given the following information:

### **Source A — Student Survey**

* 62% say buses are late
* 70% want real-time tracking
* 45% want more buses
* 30% say mornings are empty but evenings are crowded

### **Source B — College Admin**

* Budget cannot be increased
* Only 10% of buses run full
* GPS tracking pilot was done but discontinued
* Evening demand is 4× morning demand

### **Source C — Bus Drivers**

* Delays due to traffic
* Students take time because of ID scanning
* GPS devices did not work well
* Better route planning needed

**2.1** What do all three sources agree on? What do they disagree on?

**2.2** Students want more buses, but the college cannot increase the budget. Explain how you would handle this contradiction in a practical way.

**2.3** Suggest a balanced solution for improving the bus system. Use information from all three sources.

**2.4** Write three pieces of additional information that would help you make a better recommendation.

## **Section 3 — Finding Patterns**

### **Time: 20 minutes**

### **Situation A:**

College WiFi becomes slow between 2–4 PM.

### **Situation B:**

The gym is full between 6–8 PM but empty at most other times.

### **Situation C:**

The library printer queue becomes very long right before assignment deadlines.

**3.1** What is the common idea or pattern in all three situations?

**3.2** Describe this pattern in simple, general terms without mentioning WiFi, gym, or printers.

**3.3** Apply the same pattern to this situation:
“In a cafeteria with 120 seats, students sometimes cannot find seats even though the average occupancy is only 40%.”
Explain why this happens and suggest one solution.

## **Section 4 — Figuring Out Why Something Is Wrong**

### **Time: 25 minutes**

You built a simple timer app. When you set it for 10 minutes, sometimes it rings at 11 minutes, and sometimes at 9 minutes.

**4.1** Write at least four possible reasons why this might be happening.
(*Possible reason = hypothesis, your guess for why something is happening.*)

**4.2** For each reason, write a simple test to confirm it. Each test should check only one thing.

**4.3** If more than one reason seems possible, explain how you would find the actual root cause.

## **Section 5 — Working with Limits and Choosing What Matters**

### **Time: 30 minutes**

You and three friends want to build a simple FAQ chatbot for new students joining your college.

### **Requirements**

* Answer top 50 common questions
* Work on mobile
* Fast responses
* Support both text and voice input

### **Your Limits**

* 4 weeks
* All team members are beginners
* No paid tools
* Exams in Week 3
* Only 8–10 hours per week per person

**5.1** Which requirements are easy or realistic? Which are difficult or unrealistic? Why?

**5.2** Choose the top three features to build first and explain why these matter most.

**5.3** Create a practical 4-week work plan based on your limits.

**5.4** After two weeks, you realize you are behind schedule. What will you do now? Write a practical backup plan.

## **Section 6 — Quick Learning Challenge**

### **Time: 25 minutes**

Read the explanation below:

> A **Bloom Filter** is a data structure that helps you quickly check if an item is definitely not present in a set, or maybe present in the set.
> It uses several hash functions to turn items into positions in a bit array.
> If all those positions are 1, the item may be in the set.
> If even one position is 0, the item is definitely not in the set.
> It is very fast and uses very little memory.
> It can give false alarms (“maybe present” when the item is not actually present),
> but it never says “not present” when the item is actually present.

**6.1** Explain this idea in simple words, as if to a friend who is not from computer science.

**6.2** Give two real-life situations where this idea could be useful.

**6.3** Write what parts of this idea are still unclear to you.

**6.4** Write one experiment or thought experiment you could do to understand Bloom Filters better.

## **Section 7 — Reflection**

### **Time: 10 minutes**

**R.1** Which section felt easiest for you? Why?
**R.2** Which section felt hardest? Why?
**R.3** If you had to attempt this paper again, what would you change in your approach?
