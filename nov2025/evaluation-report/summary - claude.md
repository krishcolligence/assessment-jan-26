## Ranking Table

| Rank | Name | Score/32 | Band | Key Strengths | Key Concerns |
|------|------|----------|------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Nandan S. B** | 28 | Strong Hire | Exceptional synthesis (bus reallocation), strong tech awareness (Docker, AWS, Dijkstra), excellent Bloom Filter understanding, clear communication | Diagnostic plan could be more granular |
| 2 | **Shreecharan D. Hegde** | 26 | Hire | Exceptional problem breakdown (6 categories), strong pattern recognition, good real-world examples (disease detection) | Project planning less detailed, Bloom Filter experiment was analogy not test |
| 3 | **Nikhil** | 23 | Hire | Consistent performance across sections, practical suggestions (RFID), good self-awareness about verbosity | Bloom Filter misunderstanding ("not efficient in real-time"), backup plan relies on overtime |
| 4 | **Abhishek R. Bhat** | 18 | Consider | Good pattern recognition (table grouping), practical synthesis (landmark pickups, RFID) | Limited hypothesis generation (only 2), thin depth throughout, weak backup plan |
| 5 | **Ajith Hegde** | 16 | Reject | Clear writing, good insight on route planning importance, accurate Bloom Filter summary | Ignores constraints (extend timeline, increase budget), confused cafeteria explanation |
| 6 | **Chandana V R** | 16 | Reject | Honest about confusion areas, practical cafeteria solutions | Wrong pattern (work-life balance), irrelevant tangents (thermal throttling), mixes problems/solutions |
| 7 | **Ajay Hegde** | 15 | Reject | Some technical awareness (acknowledgement messages), creative timing solution | Bloom Filter fundamentally wrong (Natural numbers, if-else), pattern confusion, clarity issues |
| 8 | **Chaitali N.D** | 15 | Reject | Creative app solution thinking, four timer hypotheses | No reflection self-awareness (wants different questions), invented disagreements, literal pattern linking |
| 9 | **Shreya Savle** | 13 | Reject | Good pattern recognition (peak hours), practical cafeteria solutions | Section 1 no structure, ignores budget (EVs), inverts feasibility (voice is easy), single hypothesis |

## Key Observations

### Top Performers
- **Nandan** stands out for consistent high performance (no section below 3) with exceptional information synthesis and practical technical knowledge
- **Shreecharan** excels in structured problem breakdown and pattern recognition
- **Nikhil** shows reliable competence across all dimensions with good self-awareness

### Notable Gaps
- **Section 6 (Bloom Filter)** was challenging for most candidates; only Nandan scored 4
- **Constraint awareness** was weak across many candidates (ignoring budget, proposing timeline extensions)
- **Pattern abstraction** varied significantly — some candidates (Chandana) completely missed the pattern

### Borderline Cases
- **Abhishek (18)**: At the Consider/Reject boundary; shows potential but needs significant development
- **Ajith/Chandana (16)**: Both just below Consider threshold; Ajith has clearer writing, Chandana shows more effort but more confusion

## Recommendations

### Immediate Hire (Strong Hire)
1. **Nandan S. B** — Ready for R&D work with minimal ramp-up

### Hire with Standard Onboarding
2. **Shreecharan D. Hegde** — Strong analytical skills; would benefit from project planning mentorship
3. **Nikhil** — Solid performer; guide on conciseness and theoretical concepts

### Consider for Specific Roles
4. **Abhishek R. Bhat** — Only if role allows significant mentorship time and simpler initial assignments

### Not Recommended
5-9. **Ajith, Chandana, Ajay, Chaitali, Shreya** — Significant gaps in analytical reasoning, constraint awareness, or conceptual understanding
